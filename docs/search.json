    "text": "Abstract. This study investigates the dynamic impact of fiscal policy shifts on unemployment rates through a Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) model. Utilizing time series data for government spending, tax revenue, inflation, and unemployment rates, we analyze the interplay between fiscal activities and labor market performance within an Australian context. The SVAR model, equipped to dissect the influence of systematic fiscal shocks, reveals insights into how policy affects employment.\nKeywords. svars, fiscal policy, unemployment rates, government spending, tax revenue, inflation"

    "text": "2.3 Data Visualization\nThe time series plots[Figure 1: Time Series Data] for unemployment rate, government spending, tax revenue, and inflation collectively offer a glimpse into the interplay between fiscal policy and economic indicators in an economy. The unemployment rate displays cyclical patterns with notable spikes, hinting at its sensitivity to economic conditions and potentially reactive fiscal policies. The upward trajectories of both government spending and tax revenue suggest an expanding fiscal capacity over time, likely driven by both economic growth and policy decisions.\nGovernment spending’s steady rise, with occasional steeper inclines, could imply proactive fiscal stimulus during periods of economic downturn, which often sees a lagged corresponding dip in the unemployment rate. Tax revenue’s increase, while generally consistent with economic growth, also shows sensitivity to business cycles, indicating that it’s both a reflection of and a contributor to the fiscal environment. Inflation’s volatility is without a clear trend line.\nThese time series hint at a complex relationship where fiscal policy, through government spending and tax revenue, aims to moderate the impacts of economic cycles on unemployment, all while operating within the broader context influenced by inflation dynamics. The ebb and flow in these indicators reflect the challenges and responses in managing an economy over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime Series Data"

    "text": "2.4 Property Tested\nFrom the ACF test[Figure 2: Autocorrelation Function], the unemployment rate shows a strong initial correlation that quickly tails off, indicating that past unemployment only affects the current rate for a short period. Government spending and tax revenue, on the other hand, display more prolonged correlations, suggesting that current values are influenced by a longer history of the series. This persistence might be a sign of a trend or other non-stationary behavior in the series. Inflation shows some initial correlation that diminishes, which could be indicative of cyclical behavior being smoothed out over time.\nFrom the PACF test[Figure 3: Partial Autocorrelation Function], for unemployment, there’s a significant direct correlation with the immediate past, which is not seen in the following lags. This indicates that other than the most recent past, there’s little direct effect on the current unemployment rate. In the case of government spending, tax revenue, and inflation, the PACF plots suggest that after accounting for other factors, the direct correlations are quite minimal. This could imply that these time series are driven by a more complex set of factors than just their immediate past values.\n\n\n\n\n\nAutocorrelation Function\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartial Autocorrelation Function"
